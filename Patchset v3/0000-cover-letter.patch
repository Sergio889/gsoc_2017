Subject: [PATCH v3 00/14] add support for Hypervisor.framework in QEMU

================
Changes in v3:
 (1) Fixed licensing issues in patch 3.
 (2) Revert to late adding of compilation rules in Makefile.objs (patch 8/14);
     files aren't ready to compile earlier.
 (3) Make a single patch just for fixing style (patch 4/14).
 (4) Fix data type for hvf_fd field.
 (5) Add comment that return value of -1 in apic function added in 7/14 means
     "no interrupt".
================

================
Changes in v2:
 (1) Removed legacy option "-enable-hvf" in favor of "-M accel=hvf"
 (2) Added missing copyright headers; replace fprintfs for error_report;
     improved commit description.
 (3) Moved patch that adds compilation rules in Makefile.objs right after
     the patch that adds the new files from Google's repo.
 (4) Removed conditional macros from cpus.c and cpu.c
 (5) Moved patch that fixes coding style to patch # 3
 (6) Fix commit message in apic patch
 (7) Squash some commits to avoid code churn
================

The following patchset adds to QEMU the supporting for macOS's native
hypervisor, Hypervisor.framework (hvf). The code base is taken from
Google's Android emulator at
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/qemu/+/emu-master-dev.

Apart from general code refactoring, some additional features were implemented:
retrieve the set of features supported by host cpu and hvf (cpuid);
dirty page tracking for VGA memory area; reimplementation of the event
injection mechanism to allow injection of exceptions during vmexits, which is
exemplified by the injection of a GP fault when the guest vmexits due to
execution of the vmcall instruction; changing the emulator's use of CPUState
structure in favor of CPUX86State, so as to in the future remove data structures
that are uselessly specific to hvf and unified some of the state between kvm/tcg
and hvf.
Some features initially planned to implement that didn't make it include:
page fault handling in the emulator and implementing the dummy_signal to handle
the SIG_IPI signal without race conditions. Hopefully these can be implemented
in the near future.

Sergio Andres Gomez Del Real (14):
  hvf: add support for Hypervisor.framework in the configure script
  hvf: add code base from Google's QEMU repository
  hvf: fix licensing issues; isolate task handling code (GPL v2-only)
  hvf: run hvf code through checkpatch.pl and fix style issues
  hvf: add code to cpus.c and do refactoring in preparation for
    compiling
  hvf: handle fields from CPUState and CPUX86State
  apic: add function to apic that will be used by hvf
  hvf: add compilation rules to Makefile.objs
  hvf: use new helper functions for put/get xsave
  hvf: implement hvf_get_supported_cpuid
  hvf: refactor cpuid code
  hvf: implement vga dirty page tracking
  hvf: refactor event injection code for hvf
  hvf: inject General Protection Fault when vmexit through vmcall
